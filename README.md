Vancouver hackaton project

Solution built to help Knack - http://www.knackworks.ca/

Knack aims to increase the opportunities for impact hiring through local businesses by acknowledging the diverse range of skills and knowledge of the residents of the DTES who experience barriers to traditional employment. Its challenge to participants is to build a game-like web to (predominately) mobile app that connects Earners to badges and tasks.
